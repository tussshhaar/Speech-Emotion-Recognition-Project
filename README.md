There are two code files in the submission. Each cell is alredy executed. If you want to execute the code again, follow these steps:
1. Upload the code file to Google Colab
2. Mount your Google Drive in the runtime.
3. Upload the dataset to the mounted drive.
4. Run the code.

About The Models:
There are three models that are implemented in the project i.e. A CNN Model, a CNN+KNN Model, and A CNN+LSTM Model. The CNN Model and the CNN+KNN Model are present in the "SER_Cnn.ipynb" file. The CNN+LSTM Model is present in the "SER_hybrid.ipynb" file.
